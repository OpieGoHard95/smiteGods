CMP237 Gods of Smite Project

This code is intended to provide a number of examples of the use of array functions when applied to a real-world dataset such as the gods of a popular online game.

The dataset in this program keeps track of gods from the MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, Smite. For each item in my array, I keep a name, pantheon (what religion the god belongs to), class (hunter, mage, guardian, warrior), attack type, and power type.

Here are a couple of example entries from my dataset:

'{ "name": "xbalanque", "pantheon": "mayan", "class": "hunter", "attack type": "ranged", "power type": "physical" }'
'{ "name": "loki", "pantheon": "norse", "class": "assassin", "attack type": "melee", "power type": "physical" }'
